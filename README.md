## About

A simple CLI based application aimed towards helping foreign students using the Genki book series learn the Japanese language (full book or lesson by lesson review).

Please note that the following software has been built in the middle of my study abroad program at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies as a practicing tool. The amount of verbs were getting a bit out of hand so I wanted something that could help me memorise them. At the moment it is still incomplete, and a lot of things are still missing. However, I would like to further work on it as soon as I have the will and motivation to continue my Japanese language studies.

## Stack

- Python
- Genki book series (I and II)
